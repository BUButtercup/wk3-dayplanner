# wk3-dayplanner

This is a refactoring project: pervious code has been provided. The intention of this week's assignment was that we should modify the code files we were given to achieve the following: 
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist.

I believe I achieved the objective, and did it with minimal redundant javascript/jquery code. I did not build in a "clear content" function of any kind, which would be desirable in such a product in the future so the user didn't have to go in to each box and erase content as tasks were completed. There are many ways such a program as this could be built out into a great project management app (could be used by a team, populate things to Gantt charts, etc., etc.).

For me, building this was yet more reinforcement of learning how the language wants to be handled and the computer wants to be talked to. It is very interesting to have such intense interaction with something that is unable to understand your meaning through assumption. You need to figure out how to clearly infer your meaning. The good news is, there are usually multiple ways to do this. Hopefully, with time, I will become quicker at identifying these, and the headaches and time loss will decrease.
